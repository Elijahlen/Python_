'''
Prompts the user for two strictly positive integers, numerator and denominator.

Determines whether the decimal expansion of numerator / denominator is finite or infinite.

Then computes integral_part, sigma and tau such that numerator / denominator is of the form
integral_part . sigma tau tau tau ...
where integral_part in an integer, sigma and tau are (possibly empty) strings of digits,
and sigma and tau are as short as possible.
